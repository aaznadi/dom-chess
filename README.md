# DOM Chess

A simple chess game built entirely with DOM elements and zero dependencies.

DOM Chess takes advantage of the DOM API to implement the game of chess. The board is a `<div>`, a square is a `<div>` and a piece is an `<svg>`. A piece move is simulated with the removal of an svg from a parent square node and appending it to another.

## Features

- Non-strict mode: No rules. Any move is legal ðŸ¤¡

## Usage

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/kuka0len/dom-chess/releases/latest). Unzip to get the `dom-chess.js` file.

In your `HTML` file, add the following line where you want the game to be rendered:

```html
<div id="dom-chess"></div>
```

Then, add this line at the bottom of the `HTML`'s body:

```html
<script src="/path/to/dom-chess.js"></script>
```

It would be cool if others contribute to this small game with some badass features.
